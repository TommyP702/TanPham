<p>"optional" before making any changes to our system we need to setup window imgage / system restore incase of capatibility issue with certain appilcation our company are using</p>

<p>First fastest way is "check for updates" that usually solve 90%  vulnerability that are out of date</p>

<p>Should see for example  "224-01 Security update for windows 10 version 22h2 for x64" etc.</p>

<p> once update is done lets rescan for any leftover vulnerability that would be needed to manually fixed.</p>

Other programs I recommend Spybot Search & Destroy and Anti-beacon

<p>Will conclude on this that vulnerability will always popup no matter how much we try to harden system, but thats is what makes cyber security challenging as threat continue to grow</p>
