<p>we can now setup our username: admin , Password: Password , and Domain: user login name (go onto CMD or powershell and type in "whoami": to see who you are logon as. </p>


<p>to get Admin rights to do the credential scan we need to search -> "services" -> remote registry -> double click  -> change startup type: disable to Automatic </p>

<p>next we need to change User Account Control Setting (UAC) we can do this by going into our control or in our search tab and type in UAC, the application will pop up and we can drag the slider down to never notify so in the future any scan we make to our system will not be block/delay by windows feature.</p>
