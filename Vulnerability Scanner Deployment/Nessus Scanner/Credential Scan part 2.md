<p>for this part go to the tab "my scans" and click on our recent project on the right side click on "configure" then we will go into the credential tab then lets select Windows </p>

<p>we can now setup our username: admin , Password: Password , and Domain: user login name (go onto CMD or powershell and type in "whoami": to see who you are logon as. </p>


<p>to get Admin rights to do the credential scan we need to search -> "services" -> remote registry -> double click  -> change startup type: disable to Automatic </p>

<p>next we need to change User Account Control Setting (UAC) we can do this by going into our control or in our search tab and type in UAC, the application will pop up and we can drag the slider down to never notify so in the future any scan we make to our system will not be block/delay by windows feature.</p>

<p>Find Folder destination: Computer/HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/SOFTWARE/Microsoft/Windows/CurrentVersion/Policies/System</p>
<p>Create Dword (32bit) value  called  "LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy" change they value 0(disable) to 1(enable)</p>

<p>once done, lets restart our window virtual machine and relaunch Nessus rescan to see more vulnerability</p>

<p>Once we're done we now need to generate report, by click on the report tab on the top right.</p>

<p>will then give us the option to download it into a PDF.file we then can send this report to stakeholder, higher ups etc.</p>

<p>This conclude our Credential scanning part 2, next I'll be given the green light to remediate the listed vulnerabilites </p>
