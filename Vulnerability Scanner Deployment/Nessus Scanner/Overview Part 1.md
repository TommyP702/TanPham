<p>before launching our network scan, lets open up 2 powershell (admin) and type in "ipconfig" one one of the powershell and the other we can type in "ping" our IPv4</p>

<p>once done we see 1 vulnerabilities that caught our eyes "SMB signing" on Medium and CVSS 5.3 we can click on it for more detail and see how we can resolve this</p>

<p>The fastest way to resolve this is by updating our window x64 base-system in control panel > windows update, after that do another rescan if vulnerability is there we can manually change registry keys, Nessus has provide links to manuelly fix the vulnerability. </p>
